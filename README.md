ghostlice
=========


About
-----

Ghostlice is a library of general-purpose utilities for slices of
numbers in Go (Golang)[http://golang.org].  The utilities are available
primarily as functions but also methods as appropriate.

The name exists because it sounds like "Go slice" and because it is a
suitably original repository name that is also a legal identifier in Go
(avoiding the problems of "go-slice").  Plus, it is amusing to ponder
what ghost lice might be or to consider using "Go host lice!" as a mild
insult.

Ghostlice is also an experiment in how to do templating for Go as simply
as possible.
